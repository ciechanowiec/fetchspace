== Overview
_Fetch Space_ is a https://telegram.org/[Telegram] bot that instantly generates a shareable link for any file the user uploads. The user sends a file, and receives a public internet link to easily share it with anyone.

== Features
[upperalpha]
. *Unlimited Uploads*
+
Share as many files as you like - there's no limit. Each file can be up to 2GB in size.

. *Anonymous Downloads*
+
The links you generate don't require any account or registration to access.
. *Free. Forever*
+
We pay for hosting so that you don't need to.

. *Integrated with Telegram*
+
No need to install separate apps. Everything works right within Telegram.

== Usage
[upperalpha]
. *Start the Bot*
+
Open https://t.me/FetchSpaceBot on Telegram and start the bot.
.  *Upload Your File*
+
In the chat input area, select _File_ as the input type and send it to the bot. Besides _File_ as input type, the bot also accepts videos from gallery, music and voice messages.

. *Get Your Link*
+
The bot will respond with a public link to the file you uploaded, such as https://fetchspace.org/api/assets.download.41d66272-51c0-4511-9b07-30e69e0c62ff.zip. Anyone who has the link can anonymously, without login and registration download the file.

. *Manage Your Files*
+
Want to deactivate your links? Issue a `/clear` command to delete all files you've uploaded to the bot. Once deleted, the links to deleted files will no longer work.

== Technical Aspects
=== General
[upperalpha]
. _Fetch Space_ runs inside https://github.com/ciechanowiec/sling_rocket[Sling Rocket] web framework.
. _Fetch Space_ uses https://github.com/ciechanowiec/sling_tg[Sling TG] addon to https://github.com/ciechanowiec/sling_rocket[Sling Rocket] web framework for integration with Telegram.
. The purpose of _Fetch Space_ is to show the example of a production application based on https://github.com/ciechanowiec/sling_rocket[Sling Rocket] and https://github.com/ciechanowiec/sling_tg[Sling TG].

=== Deployment
The steps below describe the deployment procedure of a new instance of a _Fetch Space_ application.
[upperalpha]
. Remove all preceding _Fetch Space_ containers, images, volumes and networks:

    docker stop rocket-instance telegram-bot-api rocket-backuper rocket-nginx; docker rm rocket-instance telegram-bot-api rocket-backuper rocket-nginx; docker volume rm rocket-data-raw rocket-data-dump telegram-bot-api-data; docker network rm rocket-network

. Go to the root of this code repository in terminal.
. Create a `.env` file in the root of this code repository and set there required deployment variables. The file should have this structure:
+
[source,bash]
....
COMPOSE_PARALLEL_LIMIT=1
RUN_MODES=prod
IS_STAGING_ENV=true
BOT_TOKEN_PROD=...
BOT_TOKEN_STAGING=...
CHATS_WITH_MODERATORS_IDS=...
# `api_id` for Telegram Bot API Server (https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id#obtaining-api-id):
TELEGRAM_API_ID=...
# `api_hash` for Telegram Bot API Server (https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id#obtaining-api-id):
TELEGRAM_API_HASH=...
....

. Start https://github.com/ciechanowiec/sling_rocket[Sling Rocket]:

    docker compose up -d

. Save a new password for the `admin` user of https://github.com/ciechanowiec/sling_rocket[Sling Rocket] in a variable:

    export NEW_ROCKET_PASSWORD=NEW_ROCKET_PASSWORD_VALUE

. Set the new password for the `admin` user of https://github.com/ciechanowiec/sling_rocket[Sling Rocket]:
+
[source,bash]
....
curl --user "admin:admin" --verbose -FoldPwd=admin -FnewPwd="$NEW_ROCKET_PASSWORD" -FnewPwdConfirm="$NEW_ROCKET_PASSWORD" \
  http://localhost:8080/system/userManager/user/admin.changePassword.html
....

. Build the _Fetch Space_ application and deploy it into the running _Sling Rocket_ instance:

    mvn clean install -P installAll -D sling.password="$NEW_ROCKET_PASSWORD"
